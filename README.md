# AEDA-FEUP

Second part and final version of project developed for Algorithms and Data Structures at FEUP.   


### Theme 8 - Shared Rides - Lyfter  

## Objectives  

Create a program for the management of a social network built on ride sharing.

### Requirements:
● Two types of users: casual and registered (with vehicles and without vehicles).    
● Dynamic counting of the number of seats available during a route, as people leave and others enter.  
● Buddy relationships amongst users for convenience.  
● Billing system, with different rates for drivers and non-drivers, registered and casual users.   
● Important information, such as users, trips, etc. should be saved and loaded for posterior use and to maintain integrity.    
● BST integration through filtered searches, such as by vehicle brand, model or year (type was done as well).    
● Hashtable integration in order to keep track of inactive and active users and to update their info for future campaigns.       
● Priority Queue integration to prioritize the access of users to trips taking into account buddy relationships and distance.
